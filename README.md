# NetworkAnalysis_MachineLearning_PatentCitation
This repo stores some of my practicing jupyter notebooks. The topic of data being used and analyzed is mainly about patents and citation networks.
The contents of those notebooks range from data collecting to model building. Including:
  * Data collecting using webscraping and API (Pandas, Request, BeautifulSoup)
  * DB-API and SQL Magic in jupyter notebook (MySQL)
  * Network Analysis: global network structure analysis, node centraltiy, community detection, network visualization. (NetworkX)
  * Machine Learning: Try to use preprocessed attribute features to train ML models to predict network characteristics. (Sci-Kit Learn)
  * Deep Learning: Same as above, but using neural network model. (Keras, scikeras)
  * Unsupervised Leaning: Try to use dimensional reduction clustering
  * A simple practicing notebook about CNN
  * A simple practicing notebook about RNN
